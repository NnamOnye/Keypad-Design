# Keypad-PCB(KiCAD)
# Developed by M.O Using KiCAD
# This is a keypad system using cherry switches(MX1A-11NN), an esp32(ESP32-S2-SAOLA-1R,ESP32-S2-SAOLA-1M,or ESP32-S2-Wrover), an LCD display, and a LDO(Low Drop Out regulator).
# This keypad can be used/intergrated into many different applications (door lock,calculator,biometric lock,etc..)
# KiCAD will be needed for this project if replicating.
